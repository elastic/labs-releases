## Unmasking a Financial Services Intrusion: REF0657

In December of 2023, Elastic Security Labs detected a smash-and-grab style intrusion directed at a financial services organization in South Asia. Throughout the breach, a diverse set of open-source tools were employed within the victim's environment, some of which we encountered for the first time. The threat group engaged in different post-compromise activities: from discovery/enumeration to utilizing the victim's internal enterprise software against them and eventually leveraging different tunnelers and side-loading techniques to execute Cobalt Strike. In addition, the adversary used the file hosting service Mega to exfiltrate data from the network.

Instructions are in the root [indicators](../README.md) directory.
