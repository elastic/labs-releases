## PIKABOT indicators by Elastic Security Labs

PIKABOT is a widely deployed loader malicious actors utilize to distribute payloads such as Cobalt Strike or launch ransomware. On February 8th, the Elastic Security Labs team [observed](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/pikabot-i-choose-you) new PIKABOT campaigns, including an updated variant. This version of the PIKABOT loader uses a new unpacking method and heavy obfuscation. The core module has added a new string decryption implementation, changes to obfuscation functionality, and various other modifications

Instructions are in the root [indicators](../README.md) directory.
