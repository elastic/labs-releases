## GHOSTENGINE indicators by Elastic Security Labs

Elastic Security Labs has identified a campaign incorporating several malicious modules and leveraging vulnerable drivers to disable known security solutions (EDRs). Additionally, the team discovered capabilities to establish persistence, install a previously undocumented backdoor, and execute a crypto-miner. We refer to this intrusion set as REF4578 and the primary payload as GHOSTENGINE (tangental research by the team at Antiy has named parts of this intrusion set HIDDENSHOVEL).

Instructions are in the root [indicators](../README.md) directory.
