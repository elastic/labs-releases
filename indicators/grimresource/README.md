## GrimResource indicators by Elastic Security Labs

Elastic researchers have uncovered a new infection technique also leveraging MSC files, which we refer to as GrimResource. It allows attackers to gain full code execution in the context of mmc.exe after a user clicks on a specially crafted MSC file. A sample leveraging GrimResource was first uploaded to VirusTotal on June 6th.

Instructions are in the root [indicators](../README.md) directory.
