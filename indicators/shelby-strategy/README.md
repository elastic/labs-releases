## Shelby malware and REF8685 indicators by Elastic Security Labs

As part of Elastic Security Labs' ongoing research into emerging threats, we analyzed a potential phishing email sent from an email address belonging to an Iraqi telecommunications company and sent to other employees of that same company. This phishing email began an infection chain that led to the deployment of the novel malware family we've named SHELBY, based on strings in the code, part of the REF8685 intrusion set.

Instructions are in the root [indicators](../README.md) directory
