## REF6138 indicators by Elastic Security Labs

Elastic Security Labs has uncovered a sophisticated Linux malware campaign targeting vulnerable servers. The attackers initiated the compromise in March 2024 by exploiting an Apache2 web server. Gaining initial access under the www-data user, they deployed a complex toolkit to establish persistence and expand their control over the compromised host.

Instructions are in the root [indicators](../README.md) directory.
