## ICEDID malware analysis tools by Elastic Security Labs

ICEDID is a malware family discovered in 2017 by IBM X-force researchers and is associated with the theft of login credentials, banking information, and other personal information. ICEDID has been linked to the distribution of several distinct malware families including DarkVNC and COBALT STRIKE.

ICEDID is known to pack its payloads using custom file formats and a custom encryption scheme. Elastic Security Labs is releasing a set of tools to automate the unpacking process and help analysts and the community respond to ICEDID.

These tools are operated by Elastic Security Labs' [nightMARE](../../nightMARE) framework.
